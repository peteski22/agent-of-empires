# Agent of Empires (aoe)

A terminal session manager using tmux to aid in management and monitoring of AI coding agents, written in Rust.

This project was inspired by [agent-deck](https://github.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck) (Go + Bubble Tea), but written in Rust with a simplified architecture and extended functionality.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install njbrake/aoe/aoe
# update via brew update && brew upgrade aoe
```

Or clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/njbrake/agent-of-empires
cd agent-of-empires
cargo build --release
# Binary at target/release/aoe
```

## How It Works

Agent of Empires (aoe) is a wrapper around [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), the terminal multiplexer. Each AI coding session you create is actually a tmux session under the hood.

Once you attach to a session, you're working directly in tmux. Basic tmux knowledge helps:

| tmux Command | What It Does |
|--------------|--------------|
| `Ctrl+b d` | Detach from session (return to Agent of Empires) |
| `Ctrl+b [` | Enter scroll/copy mode |
| `Ctrl+b c` | Create new window within session |
| `Ctrl+b n` / `Ctrl+b p` | Next/previous window |

If you're new to tmux, the key thing to remember is `Ctrl+b d` to detach and return to the TUI.

## Features

- **TUI Dashboard** - Visual interface to manage all your AI coding sessions
- **Session Management** - Create, attach, detach, and delete sessions
- **Group Organization** - Organize sessions into hierarchical folders
- **Status Detection** - Automatic status detection for Claude Code and OpenCode
- **tmux Integration** - Sessions persist in tmux for reliability
- **Multi-profile Support** - Separate workspaces for different projects

## Requirements

- **tmux** - Required for session management (installed automatically via Homebrew)
  - macOS: `brew install tmux`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install tmux`
  - Familiarity with basic tmux operations is recommended (see [How It Works](#how-it-works) above)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Launch the TUI
aoe

# Or add a session directly from CLI
aoe add /path/to/project
```

## Using the TUI

### Launching

```bash
aoe           # Launch TUI with default profile
aoe -p work   # Launch with a specific profile
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Navigation** | |
| `j` / `↓` | Move down |
| `k` / `↑` | Move up |
| `h` / `←` | Collapse group |
| `l` / `→` | Expand group |
| `g` | Go to top |
| `G` | Go to bottom |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown` | Page navigation |
| **Actions** | |
| `Enter` | Attach to selected session |
| `n` | Create new session |
| `d` | Delete selected session |
| `r` / `F5` | Refresh session list |
| **Other** | |
| `/` | Search sessions |
| `?` | Toggle help overlay |
| `q` / `Ctrl+c` | Quit TUI |

### Attaching and Detaching from Sessions

1. **Attach to a session**: Select a session and press `Enter`
   - The TUI will temporarily exit and you'll be connected to the tmux session

2. **Detach from a session**: Press `Ctrl+b` then `d`
   - This is tmux's standard detach sequence
   - You'll return to the Agent of Empires TUI

3. **Alternative detach** (if already in tmux): The session will be switched, use `Ctrl+b d` to return

### Session Status Indicators

- 🟢 **Running** - Agent is actively processing
- 🟡 **Waiting** - Agent is waiting for input
- ⚪ **Idle** - Session is inactive
- 🔴 **Error** - An error was detected

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Session management
aoe add <path>              # Add a new session
aoe add . --title "my-proj" # Add with custom title
aoe list                    # List all sessions
aoe list --json             # List as JSON
aoe remove <id|title>       # Remove a session
aoe status                  # Show status summary

# Session lifecycle
aoe session start <id>      # Start a session
aoe session stop <id>       # Stop a session
aoe session restart <id>    # Restart a session
aoe session attach <id>     # Attach to a session
aoe session show <id>       # Show session details

# Groups
aoe group create <name>     # Create a group
aoe group list              # List groups
aoe group delete <name>     # Delete a group

# Profiles
aoe profile list            # List profiles
aoe profile create <name>   # Create a profile
aoe profile delete <name>   # Delete a profile

# Maintenance
aoe update                  # Check for updates
aoe uninstall               # Uninstall Agent of Empires
```

## Configuration

### Profiles

Profiles let you maintain separate workspaces with their own sessions and groups. This is useful when you want to keep different contexts isolated—for example, work projects vs personal projects, or different client engagements.

```bash
aoe                 # Uses "default" profile
aoe -p work         # Uses "work" profile
aoe -p client-xyz   # Uses "client-xyz" profile
```

Each profile stores its own `sessions.json` and `groups.json`, so switching profiles gives you a completely different set of sessions.

### File Locations

Configuration is stored in `~/.agent-of-empires/`:

```
~/.agent-of-empires/
├── config.toml           # Global configuration
├── profiles/
│   └── default/
│       ├── sessions.json # Session data
│       └── groups.json   # Group structure
└── logs/                 # Session logs
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |

## Dependencies

Key dependencies:
- `ratatui` + `crossterm` - TUI framework

- `reqwest` - HTTP client for updates

## FAQ

### Using aoe with mobile SSH clients (Termius, Blink, etc.)

If you're connecting via SSH from a mobile app like Termius, you may encounter issues when attaching to sessions. The recommended approach is to run `aoe` inside a tmux session:

```bash
# Start a tmux session first
tmux new-session -s main

# Then run aoe inside it
aoe
```

When you attach to an agent session, tmux will switch to that session. To navigate back to `aoe` use the tmux command `Ctrl+b L` to switch to last session (toggle back to aoe)
