# Logging

Agent of Empires uses the [`tracing`](https://docs.rs/tracing) crate. The TUI, the `aoe serve` daemon, the cockpit runner subprocesses, and env-overridden one-shot CLI invocations all share `src/logging.rs` so they agree on env-var resolution, default filter construction, the reloadable subscriber handle, and the sink resolver. Every process appends to the same configured log file (`~/.agent-of-empires/debug.log` by default) so a single tail covers an entire session.

## Targets

Targets use the convention `<module>.<submodule>`. The default filter expands a chosen level to a directive per top-level root, so target names like `auth.token` inherit from `auth` without per-target env config.

Only a small set of sub-targets is enumerated in the settings dropdown (see `KNOWN_SUB_TARGETS` in `src/logging.rs`). Code is free to emit under any sub-target it wants; the dropdown is for convenience. Advanced filters can be entered as raw EnvFilter directives in the settings UI's filter field or via `PATCH /api/log-level`.

| Root | What lands here |
|------|-----------------|
| `agent_of_empires` | Default crate target. General library code emitting without `target:`. |
| `cockpit` | ACP transport, supervisor, event store, runner shim, per-tool-call entry/exit. |
| `terminal` | Web terminal WS relay + per-byte firehose (trace). |
| `auth` | Token rotate, middleware accept/reject, rate-limit, login flow. |
| `process` | Signal sends, process-tree walks, survivor reap, ppid resolution. |
| `update` | GitHub release polling, cache hits/misses, version compare. |
| `containers` | Docker daemon, image pull, container lifecycle, exec into running container. |
| `git` | `git` invocation arguments, exit, duration. |
| `migrations` | Per-migration progress with duration. |
| `web` | Browser-side events relayed via `/api/client-log` under `web.client`. The client-side module name is preserved in the `client_target` field. |
| `cli` | One-shot CLI subcommand entry/exit and outcome (e.g. `cli.serve`, `cli.add`). |
| `tui` | TUI key dispatch, screen transitions, dialog lifecycle, sampled render diagnostics. |
| `session` | Session/profile/group CRUD, terminal capture, heartbeat writes, storage IO. |
| `tmux` | tmux invocations, cache refresh, status detection, pane CRUD. |
| `http` | Axum request-scoped span with `request_id`/`method`/`path`/`status`/`latency_ms`, plus per-route semantic events. |
| `serve` | `aoe serve` daemonize/foreground startup, PID/URL file IO, tunnel up/down, signal-driven shutdown. |
| `hooks` | Agent hook integration (Claude/Settl/Hermes/Kiro) install/uninstall and hook status file lifecycle. |
| `sound` | Notification sound asset download/install and per-event playback. |
| `log.runtime` | Filter swaps (REST + runner file-watch). |

## Levels

- **error** — user-visible failure or invariant violation
- **warn** — recovered from, but worth investigating (rate-limit lockout, SIGTERM survivor, garbled runtime-filter file)
- **info** — lifecycle / state transitions (token rotate, container start, migration completed)
- **debug** — frequent / per-operation detail (every git invocation, every signal)
- **trace** — per-byte / per-message firehose (`terminal.ws.bytes`, ACP JSON-RPC transport)

## Env variables

Resolved once at startup in `LogConfig::from_env`:

| Var | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `AOE_LOG_LEVEL` | `trace`/`debug`/`info`/`warn`/`error`. Sets the level across all known target roots. |
| `AGENT_OF_EMPIRES_DEBUG` | Legacy alias for `AOE_LOG_LEVEL=debug`. |
| `AOE_ACP_TRACE` | Overlay: `agent_client_protocol=debug` + the JSON-RPC transport_actor at trace. |
| `AOE_TERMINAL_TRACE` | Overlay: `terminal=trace` (per-byte firehose). |

## Sinks by process

One sink resolver (`logging::resolve_sink`) picks where each process writes based on `ProcessContext` + `[logging]`:

| Invocation | Context | `output = "stdout"` honored? | Default sink |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Any `aoe` with env var set, single-command | `OneShotCli` | yes | configured file (default `debug.log`) |
| `aoe serve` (foreground) | `ServeForeground` | yes | configured file |
| `aoe serve --daemon` child | `ServeDaemonChild` | no (coerced to file) | configured file |
| TUI (`aoe` with no subcommand) | `Tui` | no (coerced to file) | configured file |
| Cockpit runner subprocess | `Runner` | no (coerced to file) | configured file |
| Other one-shot CLI, no env | — | n/a | no subscriber |

The TUI, daemon child, and runner coerce because their stdout would corrupt the alt-screen, be detached to /dev/null, or be unreachable. Coercion surfaces a `log.runtime` warning at startup so users see why their `output = "stdout"` didn't apply.

The daemon's stdout/stderr are also redirected at the OS level to the same configured log file. That preserves panic backtraces (and any stray `println!`) alongside the structured tracing stream. An inherited file descriptor may go stale after a mid-run rotation; the daemon keeps writing to the rotated `.1` until restart. This is best-effort, not load-bearing.

## Persistent configuration (`[logging]` in `config.toml`)

The settings UI (web dashboard *Settings → Logging*, TUI *Settings → Logging*) writes a `[logging]` section to `~/.agent-of-empires/config.toml`:

```toml
[logging]
default_level = "info"

# Sink and rotation knobs (changes require restart):
output = "file"          # "file" | "stdout"
file_path = "debug.log"  # relative -> app_dir, absolute -> verbatim
rotation = "size"        # "size" | "never"
max_size_mib = 50
keep_count = 5

# Whether the formatter prefixes each event with the span chain wrapping
# it (e.g. `http_request{request_id=... method=GET path=...}` from the
# per-request middleware). Off by default keeps the log readable; turn
# on for grep-correlation when triaging across async boundaries.
# Restart required.
show_spans = false

[logging.targets]
"cockpit.acp" = "trace"
"auth.middleware" = "debug"
"process.signal" = "warn"
```

`default_level` is the baseline; entries in `targets` override per target. The list of targets surfaced as dropdowns mirrors `KNOWN_SUB_TARGETS` in `src/logging.rs`. Anything else can still be set via raw EnvFilter syntax through the runtime endpoint or CLI.

**Hot-swap vs restart:** `default_level` and `targets` hot-swap through the same `FilterController` that powers `aoe log-level`, including propagation to cockpit runners via the `runtime_filter` notify watcher. No daemon restart needed for filter changes. The sink-shape fields (`output`, `file_path`, `rotation`, `max_size_mib`, `keep_count`) are set once at process startup and require a restart to take effect; the settings UI labels them accordingly.

## Rotation

When `rotation = "size"`, the writer rotates the live file whenever it crosses `max_size_mib`. The rename chain shifts `debug.log.N-1 → .N` down to `keep_count`, then renames the current `debug.log → debug.log.1` and opens a fresh `debug.log`. Older files (`> keep_count`) are dropped.

**Multi-process safety.** The TUI + daemon + cockpit runners + env-overridden CLI invocations may all append to the same `debug.log` concurrently. The writer uses three mechanisms to keep that safe:

1. **`fs2` advisory exclusive lock** on a sidecar `{path}.lock` file serializes the rename chain. The OS releases the lock on process exit, so a crashed rotater never wedges future rotations.
2. **Inode tracking + reopen.** Each writer remembers the file's inode at open time and re-stats every 16 KiB. If another process rotated the file out from under us, the inode mismatch triggers a reopen so subsequent writes land in the new `debug.log` rather than the archived `.1`.
3. **Line-buffered writes.** Tracing events accumulate in an internal buffer until a `\n` (or 8 KiB without one); only complete lines pass through the rotation check, so a rotation can never split one event across files.

Set `rotation = "never"` to disable the size threshold entirely. The file grows unbounded; useful for debug sessions where rotation noise would interfere.

## Startup marker

`init_subscriber` writes a raw line to the sink before tracing takes ownership:

```
2025-08-15T... INFO log.runtime [AOE_START_MARKER] version=1.7.0 pid=12345 exe=/usr/local/bin/aoe
```

This is filter-immune (it bypasses the tracing subscriber entirely) so it survives any `default_level` setting and gives forensic readers a hard boundary between process runs. A parallel `tracing::info!(target: "log.runtime", "aoe started")` is also emitted once the subscriber is live; it respects the user's filter.

When the sink is stdout (foreground `aoe serve` with `output = "stdout"`, or env-overridden one-shot CLI), the marker is written to stdout too. Any tool piping or capturing the output will see the line before any structured event. That is intentional, so a captured stream is grep-compatible with a captured log file.

The TUI serve dialog uses captured file-offset-before-spawn (not the marker) to bound its tail pane, so the marker is a forensic / `grep` convenience rather than UI-load-bearing.

## Runtime control

### REST

| Method | Path | Body | Notes |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| `GET` | `/api/log-level` | — | `{current, reloadable, ephemeral}`. Returns 200 even when no controller is installed. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/log-level` | `{"level": "<name>"}` or `{"filter": "<EnvFilter>"}` | Exactly one field. |

`{"level": "debug"}` expands across all known target roots so you don't accidentally enable debug for transitive crates like `hyper`/`rustls`/`tower`.

`{"filter": "..."}` accepts the full `EnvFilter` syntax. Regex matching is disabled (`with_regex(false)`) to reduce attack surface on an authenticated HTTP input. Bare global levels (`"filter": "debug"`) are rejected with 400; use the `level` form instead.

Responses include `previous` and `current` directives. Changes are ephemeral; restart falls back to the env-var resolution.

### CLI

```
aoe log-level <level>             # safe expansion across known roots
aoe log-level --filter <expr>     # raw EnvFilter
aoe log-level --get               # print current
```

Examples:

```sh
aoe log-level debug
aoe log-level --filter cockpit.acp=trace,info
aoe log-level --filter auth.rate_limit=debug,warn
aoe log-level --get
```

The CLI reads the daemon URL from `serve.url` and authenticates via the token in the query string. Works against a foreground `aoe serve` too — it does not require the daemon mode.

## Runner propagation

When you `PATCH /api/log-level`, the daemon writes the new directive atomically to `~/.agent-of-empires/runtime_filter` (0600). Each cockpit runner subprocess uses `notify` to watch the file and applies updates to its own `FilterController`. Both daemon and runners stay in lockstep without restart, which is the point: you can pull from `info` to `trace` mid-incident without losing in-flight agent state.

Edge cases:

- File missing: runner no-ops until the daemon writes one.
- Daemon stop: file removal does not revert runner filters; the next daemon start writes a fresh value.
- Garbled content: runner logs a `warn` to `log.runtime` and keeps its prior filter.

## Web client relay

Browser-side `window.onerror`, `unhandledrejection`, React `ErrorBoundary`, and explicit `reportError()` calls are batched and POSTed to `/api/client-log`. The server re-emits them through `tracing` at target `web.client` so they land in the same `debug.log` as everything else.

Throttle (frontend): token-bucket 10 cap, 10/s refill, batches flush every 2s / 20 entries / ~48 KB. `pagehide` and `visibilitychange === "hidden"` flush via `navigator.sendBeacon` with a JSON Blob so logs survive page navigation.

Caps (server): max 50 entries per batch (413 otherwise), message truncated to 4 KB, stack to 16 KB, dynamic-target field sanitised and capped at 64 characters. URL is sanitised client-side to drop the `?token=` query param before transmission.

Not captured (intentional, v1): `console.error`. Wrapping it produces noisy duplicates and recursion hazards; if you need it later, flag-gate it.

## File locations

| Path | When it's written |
|------|-------------------|
| `<configured file_path>` (default `~/.agent-of-empires/debug.log`) | Every process that installs a tracing subscriber (TUI, foreground / daemon `aoe serve`, cockpit runner, env-overridden CLI). The daemon's stdout/stderr is also redirected here at the OS level for panic backtrace capture. |
| `<configured>.1` ... `<configured>.<keep_count>` | Rotated files, oldest at the highest number. |
| `<configured>.lock` | Idle `fs2` advisory lock file used to serialize rotation across processes. Always present after the first rotation; do not delete while any aoe process is running. |
| `~/.agent-of-empires/runtime_filter` | Atomically written on every successful `aoe log-level` swap; consumed by runner watchers. |
| `~/.agent-of-empires/cockpit-workers/<session-id>.log` | Touched for compatibility; structured tracing lands in the shared configured log file. |
| `~/.agent-of-empires/serve.log.legacy` | One-shot rename of the pre-consolidation `serve.log` by migration v007. Safe to delete once you've extracted any data you needed. |

On Linux, replace `~/.agent-of-empires` with `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent-of-empires`. Debug builds use `~/.agent-of-empires-dev` to avoid colliding with an installed release.

The `aoe logs` viewer and the TUI serve dialog both call `logging::resolve_log_path` so the configured `file_path` is the single source of truth. `aoe logs --serve` and `aoe logs --all` were removed when `serve.log` was retired; the current default `debug.log` carries everything.

## Conventions

- Set `target:` explicitly when filtering granularity below the crate level matters. The default crate path (`agent_of_empires`) suffices for grab-bag logs.
- Use structured fields, not interpolated text: `tracing::warn!(target: "auth.rate_limit", ip = %addr, attempts = n, "lockout")` rather than `warn!("lockout for ip {addr} ({n} attempts)")`. Field-based filtering and grep both win.
- Don't log secrets. Token material is never logged; auth events carry a `reason` field instead. Git command args are redacted (`https://***@host/...`) before tracing emit.
- Add new top-level target roots to `DEFAULT_TARGET_ROOTS` in `src/logging.rs` so the runtime control's `{"level": ...}` expansion picks them up.
